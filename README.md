# Random Things Handbook

This repository is basically a collection of all the guides and information I have collected over time. It will contain things like:

- Linux desktop and server administration
- Game dev stuff
- Programming stuff
- Other more general things

I decided to assemble this repo to ensure that I will always have a nicely organised collection of information and guides that can be accessed whenever I will need to.
